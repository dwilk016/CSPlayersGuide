// Level 2: Getting and IDE

/*
I will be working on this in two places. At home and At 
work, as such I will need two different environments to 
work in that sync. As such I have decieded that I will use
GITHUB as my note taking platform as I can easily edit and 
take notes at work and then sync the changes to my computer
at home. Since the computers are locked down at work I will
have to use an online compiler to run code. I will use 
Replit.com if I really need to compile something at work, 
Otherwise I will wait until I get home.

/*
At home I will use Visual Studio for editing and compiling.

Challenge: Install Visual Studio
