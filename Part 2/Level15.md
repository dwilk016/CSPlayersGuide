# Level 15: Object-Oriented Concepts
Objects belong to classes. A class can have many different objects and instances of classes (objects) can be created as the program runs. Objects the belong to the same class have the same elements and methods. C# has many ways to define new types from built-in ones, including enumerations, tuples, structs, and classes, with classes being the most sophisticated.
