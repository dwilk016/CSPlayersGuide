# Level 3: Hello World: Your First Program

## Challenge: Hello, World! (50 XP)
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
 
## Strings and Literal 
Literal - Any piece of code that defines some specific value, percisely as written. 
- `string text = "Hello, World"` - String Literal.
- `int x = 4;` - integer literal.

Identifiers - names that allow you to refer to some existing code element. Console or 
WriteLine are examples of identifiers. 

Member Access Operator (.) - establishes a hierarchical organization and is used between 
identifiers. 

## Classes and Methods:
Classes are entities that solve a single problem. 
Methods are the tasks with a Class can do. 

Methods exist inside Classes, Classes do not exist inside Methods. It is a
heirarchical order. 

The act of useing a Method is called Method Invocation or Method Call. Methods can
be passed information and return information.

Namespace - is a container for Classes and is purely for code organization.
Namespaces can be called using a using directive. 
- `using System;` - is an example of using directive.
- `System.Console.WriteLine();` - is another example.

The Base Code Library contains many namespaces each with their own classes and methods. 

Program and Main - The class Program and method Main() are the entry point for any program we write. 

Statements (;) - are a single line of code and must end in a semicolon (;).


## Challenge: What Comes Next (50 XP)
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("I have altered the plan. Pray I do not alter it further.");
```

## Challenge: The Making of a Programmer (50 XP)
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("I");
Console.WriteLine("I do");
Console.WriteLine("I do this");
Console.WriteLine("I do this to");
Console.WriteLine("I do this to take");
Console.WriteLine("I do this to take up");
Console.WriteLine("I do this to take up space!");
```

Expressions - are pieces of code that the program must evaluate. 
- `3 + 4`
- `-2 * 4.5`
- `Console.WriteLine("Hi" + "user");`

Variables - are a container for data. They consist of a type, name, and value.

`Console.WriteLine()` - Outputs text to the screen.
`Console.ReadLine()` - Reads keys from the keyboard until enter is pressed.

## Challenge: Consola and Telim (50 XP)
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Bread is Ready.");
Console.WriteLine("Who is the bread for?");
string name = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Noted: " + name + " got bread.");
```
