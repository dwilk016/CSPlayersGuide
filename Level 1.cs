/* 
C# is a general purpose programing language, that fits into a similar 
category of languages such as JAVA, C, or C++. It is built upon the 
.NET (dotnet) framework. There is a Base Class Library (BCL), which 
are thousands of pre-built pieces of code to help make your life as a 
programmer easier.
C# shares the .NET ecosystem with other languages like Visual Basic, 
F#, and PowerShell. This means that they have some commonalities that 
are shared across languages. This makes moving from one language to the 
other within the .NET framework easier.
